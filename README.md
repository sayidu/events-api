# Mock: Events API
Events API contains API endpoints which allows users to create, edit, retrieve and delete events.

## API ENDPOINTS
Access for the endpoints are restricted based on the Authorization token assigned to the user.
Users are assigned a token on creation and login to the system, this token is therefore used
to authorise access to the API endpoints.
